# Cohort Creation

A Cohort is a collection of unique person identifiers which can be linked against datasets during an extraction.  This namespace covers the creation of queries that identify lists of patients (based on inclusion / exclusion criteria).

See [CohortComitting](../CohortComitting/Readme.md) for committing (saving) a final list of patients (or for generating cohorts directly from a file etc).
