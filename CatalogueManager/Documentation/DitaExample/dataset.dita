  <title>HIC-held Datasets</title>

  <conbody>
    <p>This section of the document describes the contents of the HIC-held
    datasets currently made available to researchers and data analysts. HICâ€™s
    data collection strategy is well-developed, covering long-term collections
    of whole populations, such as Scottish Morbidity Register (SMR)
    hospitalisation data, official death certification data, and dispensed
    community prescription data, to short-term collections and
    disease-specific coverage, such as the GoDARTS (Genetics of Diabetes Audit
    and Research in Tayside, Scotland). These datasets comes in various
    formats and are curated, maintained and governed by HIC. </p>
