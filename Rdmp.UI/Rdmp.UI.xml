            Allows you to adjust an Aggregate.  This can either be a breakdown of your dataset by columns possibly including a graph (Basic Aggregate), a list of patient identifiers (Identifier 
            List) or a patient index table (See AggregateConfiguration). The image in the top left tells you what type of AggregateConfiguration it is.
             
            <para>Clicking the 'Parameters' button will launch the ParameterCollectionUI dialogue which will let you edit which SQL Parameters @startDate etc are available for use in filters on the 
            AggregateConfiguration</para>
            
            <para>If you are editing a Basic Aggregate that does not include any patient identifier columns (IsExtractionIdentifier) then you can tick IsExtractable to make it available for use and
            extraction for researchers who use the underlying dataset and receive a data extraction (they will receive the 'master' aggregate run on the entire data repository and a 'personal'
            version which is the same query run against their project extraction only) See ExtractionAggregateGraphObjectCollection.</para>
            
            <para>You can click in the SQL and Alias columns to rename columns or change their SQL.  You can also click in the 'Join Direction' column to edit the direction (LEFT or RIGHT) of 
            any supplemental JOINs.</para>
            
            <para>If your Catalogue has multiple underlying TableInfos you can pick which ones to include in the query generated in the FROM section (any Columns included in the SELECT section
            will be automatically included)</para>
            
            <para>Typing into the HAVING block will make the Query Builder add the SQL into the HAVING section of a GROUP BY SQL statement</para>
            
            <para>You can (if it is a Basic Aggregate) choose a single column to PIVOT on.  This will turn row values into new column headers.  For example if you have a dataset with columns 'Date, Gender,
            Result' then you could pivot on Gender and the result set would have columns Date,Male,Female,Other,NumberOfResults' assuming your count SQL was called NumberOfResults.  Do not pick
            a column with thousands of unique values or you will end up with a very unwieldy result set that will probably crash the AggregateGraph when run.</para>
            
            <para>One (DATE!) column can be marked as an Axis.  See AggregateContinuousDateAxisUI for description.</para>

            Allows you to limit the graph generated to X bars (in the case of a graph without an axis) or restrict the number of Pivot values returned.  For example you can graph 'Top 10 most
            prescribed drugs'.  Top X is meaningless without an order by statement, therefore you must also configure a dimension to order by (and a direction).  In most cases you should leave 
            the Dimension at 'Count Column' this will mean that whatever your count dimension is (usually count(*)) will be used to determine the TOP X.  Setting to Ascending will give you the
            lowest number e.g. 'Top 10 LEAST prescribed drugs' instead.  If you change the dimension from the 'count column' to one of your dimensions then the TOP X will apply to that column
            instead.  e.g. the 'The first 10 prescribed drugs alphabetically' (not particularly useful).

            One Dimension (Group By Column) can be set to be a 'Continuous Date Axis'.  This must be a DateTime or Date field or a transform that yields a Date/DateTime.  Normally with SQL
            when you include a Date in a GroupBy it will group it by unique value (just like any other field), most SQL users will get around this by using a function such as Year(MyDateCol) 
            to produce Aggregate of records per year.  However this approach will not fill in years where no date exists.
            
            <para>Setting an AggregateContinuousDateAxis will generate a continuous record set for the date field specified even when there are no records.  For example you can set up an axis that
            goes from 2001-01-01 to 2016-01-01 in increments of 1 month without having to worry about gaps in the axis or outlier dates (e.g. freaky dates like 1900-01-01).</para>

            Wizard with three screens allowing you to create a Cohort database for use with Data Export Manager.  A cohort database is a database which stores all the patient identifier lists 
            for all the projects you have released data for.  A Cohort is a list of patient identifiers.  All identifiers must have the same datatype (If you handle two distinct patient 
            identifiers e.g. CHI number and NHS number then you can have 2 cohort databases... or you could just standardise with a mapping table and save yourself a lot of confusion)

            the private identifiers to an anonymisation web service and wait a week before downloading the corresponding release identifiers) the RDMP does not manage the cohort database 
            directly.  If you have such an obscure release identifier allocation policy tell Screen 3 to leave the release identifiers blank and write a process/plugin for updating the cohort
            table.</para>

             <summary>
             This collection Shows all your data load configurations.  Each load configuration (LoadMetadata) is associated with 1 or more Catalogues. But each Catalogue can only have one load configuration
             
             <para>Loads are made up of a collection Process Tasks  (See PluginProcessTaskUI, SqlProcessTaskUI and ExeProcessTaskUI). which are run in sequence at pre defined states of the data load
             (RAW => STAGING => LIVE).</para>
             
             <para>Within the tree collection you can configure each stage in a data load (LoadMetadata).  A LoadMetadata is a recipe for how to load one or more datasets.  It should have a name and 
             description which accurately describes what it does (e.g. 'Load GP/Practice data' - 'Downloads PracticeGP.zip from FTP server, unzips and loads.  Also includes duplication resolution logic for 
             dealing with null vs 0 exact record duplication').</para>
             
             <para>A data load takes place across 3 stages (RAW, STAGING, LIVE - see UserManual.docx).  Each stage can have 0 or more tasks associated with it (See PluginProcessTaskUI).  The minimum requirement
             for a data load is to have an Attacher (class which populates RAW) e.g. AnySeparatorFileAttacher for comma separated files.  This supposes that your project folder loading directory 
             already has the files you are trying to load (See <see cref="T:Rdmp.Core.Curation.ILoadDirectory"/>).  If you want to build an elegant automated solution then you may choose to use a GetFiles process such as 
             FTPDownloader to fetch new files directly off a data providers server.  After this you may need to write some bespoke SQL/Python scripts etc to deal with unclean/unloadable data or 
             just to iron out idiosyncrasies in the data.</para>
              
             <para>Each module will have 0 or more arguments, each of which (when selected) will give you a description of what it expects and an appropriate control for you to choose an option. For
             example the argument SendLoadNotRequiredIfFileNotFound on FTPDownloader explains that when ticked 'If true the entire data load process immediately stops with exit code LoadNotRequired,
             if false then the load proceeds as normal'.  This means that you can end cleanly if there are no files to download or proceed anyway on the assumption that one of the other modules will
             produce the files that the load needs.</para>
            
             <para> There are many plugins that come as standard in the RDMP distribution such as the DelimitedFlatFileAttacher which lets you load files where cells are delimited by a specific character
             (e.g. commas).  Clicking 'Description' will display the plugins instructions on how/what stage in which to use it.</para>
             
             <para>DataProvider tasks should mostly be used in GetFiles stage and are intended to be concerned with creating files in the ForLoading directory</para>
             
             <para>Attacher tasks can only be used in 'Mounting' and are concerned with taking loading records into RAW tables</para>
             
             <para>Mutilator tasks operate in the Adjust stages (usually AdjustRaw or AdjustStaging - mutilating LIVE would be a very bad idea).  These can do any task on a table(s) e.g. resolve duplication</para>
              
             <para>The above guidelines are deliberately vague because plugins (especially third party plugins - see PluginManagementForm) can do almost anything.  For example you could have 
             a DataProvider which emailed you every time the data load began or a Mutilator which read data and sent it to a remote web service (or anything!).  Always read the descriptions of plugins 
             to make sure they do what you want. </para>
             
             <para>In addition to the plugins you can define SQL or EXE tasks that run during the load (See SqlProcessTaskUI and ExeProcessTaskUI). </para>

            <summary>
            Converts the contents of an existing column of your live data into anonymous identifiers.  You should only use this after backing up your database first and being very certain
            that you do not need the sensitive data being anonymised in any project extracts.
            
            <para>BACKGROUND:
            The process of anonymisation is referred to as ANO and involves moving existing identifiers into an ANOStore (separate database) and substituting in their place unique anonymous
            identifiers (there is a 1 to 1 mapping between ANO identifiers and the original values).  Each type of data (e.g. GP Code, Practice Code etc) should have it's own ANOTable with
            a unique suffix such that you can more easily trace down identifiers if you ever have to deanonymise data.  </para>
            
            <para>For example if you imagine that all GP codes must be anonymised, in your data they appear as a healthboard (T - Tayside, F - Fife) followed by 3 digits.  Then your ANOTable would
            contain the (Deleted) original values e.g. 'T402' and the substituted (ANO) identifier '3622_G'.  ANO identifiers are always a sequence of random integers and letters (you can choose
            how many letters and how many characters) followed by a suffix (in this case _G to indicate that it is a GP Code).  After Finalising the configuration, your live data table would go from
            varchar(4) to varchar(6) - to accommodate the suffix and longer number of maximum digits and all codes would be replaced with ANO codes.  This lets your data users still match across
            GPs (e.g. to identify prescribing patterns in GPs) without knowing which GP is which (which would be the case with a GP Code which can be looked up on any clinical system).</para>
            
            <para>All columns that share an ANOTable (e.g. ANOGPCode) must have the same datatype (in above example this would be varchar(4)).</para>
            
            <para>USING WINDOW:
            To use this window you must be sure that you want to transform identifiable data into anonymous format.  It is advisable to never anonymise useful result data e.g. numberOfPrescriptions) and
            stick to anonymising only categorical fields that compromise patient or carer anonymity (GP Codes, Patient identifiers etc).  Also if you never intend to process or even host certain columns
            (e.g. Firstname / Surname) then you can drop the fields entirely as part of data loading through the PreLoadDiscardedColumn mechanism).</para>
            
            <para>If the data in your column already conforms to a known type that you have anonymised before (e.g. 'GP Code' in another dataset) and the datatype matches exactly (e.g. varchar(4)) then you  
            can select an existing ANOTable and push the data straight through into ANO format.</para>
            
            <para>If not then you will need to type in a name (beginning with ANO) that refers to the type (e.g. ANOPatientIdentifier) and give it a meaningful suffix (e.g. 'P' for patient) and select 
            Create ANOTable.  Adjust the Integer/Character count till the preview data looks pleasing and no errors are reported then Finalise the choice.</para>

            Lets you configure a column in a dataset as discarded during the load process (either completely - Oblivion or stored in an identifiers only area - StoreInIdentifiersDump).
             
            <para>BACKGROUND:
            PreLoadDiscardedColumn(s) are an alternative (to ANOTables) way of anonymising dataset columns.  A well implemented anonymisation protocol will include both ANOTable substitutions 
            and PreLoadDiscardedColumns.  A PreLoadDiscardedColumn is a column containing identifiable which is NOT REQUIRED by anyone to use the dataset.  For example if you have a demography
            dataset with a PatientIdentifier, Forename and Surname then you can safely configure Forename and Surname as discarded columns because you have the unique patient identifier (which
            should have an ANOTable transform on it btw) to distinguish between patients when doing linkage. </para>
            
            <para>There are 3 types of PreLoadDiscardedColumn, each is treated differently at data load time:</para>
            
            <para>DiscardedColumnDestination:
            Oblivion - This column DOES NOT exist in the live data table but is created in the RAW load bubble so that the data can be loaded from supplied files.  The data is then deleted prior
            to the migration to STAGING
            StoreInIdentifiersDump - This column DOES NOT exist in the live data table but is created in the RAW load bubble, instead of being migrated to STAGING the data is stored in an 'identifiers
            only' area (the Identifier Dump) along with the PrimaryKeys of the data, this allows you to use the identifiers in debugging or to change your mind about anonymisation later on and reintroduce
            the discarded data back into your live database. 
            Dilute - This column DOES exist in the live data table but is diluted during load e.g. date of birth 2001-05-03 might be diluted to the first of the month (I know, its insane right but hey
            governance wants it!).</para>
            
            <para>The theory is that data analysts do not need to know patient level identifiable data to do their jobs and researchers certainly don't.  This is all entirely optional and if you 
            do not want to anonymise your data repository then don't worry about this window.</para>
            
            <para>
            Before using the form, make sure you have configured at least one IdentifierDump server.  This can be done through ManageExternalServers.  Select the Identifier Dump Server. 
            Next create some PreLoadDiscardedColumn(s) that correspond to supplied fields you do not want to go through to your live database during data load.  Each column must have a
            name and SqlDataType that matches what you are trying to load.  </para>
            
            <para>If you already have a data table and you want to drop some of the columns from it then you can paste in a list of column names and any that match known columns will automatically 
            get created as the appropriate datatype/name.  After doing that you will have to manually drop the columns yourself on your server though.</para>

            Caching is method by which long term transfer tasks take place in the RDMP.  These are usually of files and are expected to run all the time (up to 24/7).  Cached data must always be

            The ultimate end point of the Data Export Manager is the provision of a packaged up Release of all the anonymised datasets for all the cohort(s) (e.g. 'Cases' and 'Controls') in
            a research project.  There is no going back once you have sent the package to the researcher, if you have accidentally included the wrong datasets or supplied identifiable data
            (e.g. in a free text field) then you are in big trouble.  For this reason the 'Release' process is a tightly controlled sequence which the RDMP undertakes to try to reduce error.
            
            <para>In this control you will see all the currently selected datasets in a project's configuration(s) and the state of the dataset extraction (from the RDMP's perspective) as well 
            as the status of the 'Environment' (Ticketing System).  Right clicking on a dataset will give you options appropriate to it's state.</para>
            
            <para>Extraction of large datasets can take days or weeks and a project extraction is an ongoing exercise.  It is possible that by the time you come to release a project some of the
            early datasets have been changed or the files deleted etc.  The status of each extracted dataset is shown in the list box.  You can only do an extraction once all the datasets in
            the configuration are releasable.</para>
            
            <para>In addition to verifying the datasets you can tie the RDMP into your ticketing system.  For example if you have tickets for each project extraction with stages for validation
            (so that data analysts can log time against validation and sign off on it etc) then you can setup Data Export Manager when the 'Release' Ticket is at a certain state (e.g. validated).
            To configure a ticketing system see TicketingSystemConfigurationUI.</para>
            
            <para>If you haven't configured a Ticketing System then you shouldn't have to worry about the Environment State.</para>
            
            <para> Once you have selected all the configurations you want to release click Release.</para>

             The RDMP is intended to curate research datasets, including which recording which columns in a given dataset are extractable and the Governance level for those columns (e.g. can
             anyone get the column or are special approvals required).  This window lets you decide whether a CatalogueItem is extractable, optionally provide a transform (e.g. UPPER() etc),
             curate filter logic, flag it as the datasets extraction identifier (e.g. PatientId).
             
             <para>Start by deciding whether a given Column is extractable by ticking Yes or No.  Then choose an extraction category, a column will only appear in DataExportManager as extractable if
             it is Core, Supplemental or SpecialApprovalRequired (Internal and Deprecated columns cannot be extracted).  </para>
             
             <para>You should have a single field across all your datasets which identifies your cohorts (patients) e.g. PatientId.  If this column contains PatientIds then tick 'Is Extraction 
             Identifier', very occasionally you might have multiple columns containing PatientIds e.g. Birth records might have a column for MotherId and a column for BabyId both of which contain
             PatientIds (if this is the case then just tick both as 'Is Extraction Identifier'.  </para>
             
             <para>You can edit the Extraction Code which is a single line of SELECT SQL.  If you change this to include a function or something else make sure to include an alias

             <para>You can also view the Filters that are associated with this column.  These are centrally curated and validated (Make sure to validate your filters!!!) pieces of WHERE logic which
             can be used in Data Extraction and Cohort Identification with the dataset.  For example the Prescribing.DrugCode column could have 2 filters 'Prescription Painkillers' and 
             'Diabetes Drugs'.  Filters should be adequately documented with name and description such that a data analyst can use them without necessarily understanding the SQL implementation.
             For more information on configuring Filters see ExtractionFilterUI.</para>
             
             <para>If you tick the HashOnDataRelease column then the transform/column will be wrapped by the Hashing Algorithm (if any - See ConfigureHashingAlgorithm) when it comes to data extraction.

            One major problem with research data curation/provision is that data analysts who routinely work with datasets build up an in-depth knowledge of the data and how to identify 
            interesting subsets (e.g. 'How to identify all lab test codes for Creatinine').  This can involve complicated SQL which can end up buried in undocumented extraction scripts 
            or kept in the head of the data analyst and lost if he ever leaves the organisation.
            
            <para>RDMP Filters are an attempt to reduce this risk by centralising SQL 'WHERE' logic into clearly defined and documented reusable blocks (called Filters).  These named filters can
            then be combined/used by new data analyst who don't necessarily understand the exact implementation.  For this to work it is vital that you accurately name and describe what each
            filter does, including any peculiarities and that you robustly test the SQL in the implementation to make sure it actually works.</para>
            
            <para>To write the actual implementation type into the SQL prompt (omitting the 'WHERE' keyword).  For example you could create a Filter called 'Active Records Only' with a description
            'This filter throws out all records which have expired because a clinician has deleted them or the patient has withdrawn consent' and implmenetation SQL of 'MyTable.IActive=1'. Make
            sure to fully specify the names of columns in your WHERE SQL incase the filter is used as part of a join across multiple tables with columns that contain the same name (e.g. it might
            be that many other tables also include a field called IsActive).  Make sure you fully explore your dataset before finalising your filter and consider edge cases e.g. what does it mean
            when IsActive is null? are there any values above 1? and if so what does that mean?</para>
            
            <para>If you want to parameterise your query (e.g. a filter for 'Approved name of drug like X') then just type a parameter like you normally would e.g. 'Prescription.DrugName like @drugName'
            and save. This will automatically create an empty parameter (See ParameterCollectionUI).</para>

            <para>Parameters exist at multiple levels within the system and it is possible that you are editing parameters that are not at the top level.  For example, you are configuring an extract
            in which the global parameter @drugCodesOfInterest is declared for all datasets in the project and you have just opened a Filter.  In this context you will see some greyed out
            'Overriding' parameters, these are available for use at lower levels but cannot be changed (because the new Value would be applied to all users of the global i.e. all datasets in the

            <summary>
            Many researchers like flat tables they can load into SPSS or STATA or Excel and thus would prefer not to deal with multiple tables if possible.  Storing datasets as flat
            tables however is often suboptimal in terms of performance and storage space.  Therefore it is possible to configure a dataset (Catalogue) which includes columns from 
            multiple tables.  For example if you have a Header and Results table in which Header tells you when a test was done and by whom including sample volume etc and each test
            gives multiple results (white blood cell count, red blood cell count etc) then you will obviously want to store it as two separate tables.
            
            <para>Configuring join logic in RDMP enables the QueryBuilder to write an SQL SELECT query including a LEFT JOIN / RIGHT JOIN / INNER JOIN over two or more tables.  If you don't
            understand what an SQL Join is then you should research this before using this window.  Unlike a Lookup (See LookupConfiguration) it doesn't really matter which table contains
            the ForeignKey and which contains the PrimaryKey since changing the Join direction effectively inverts this logic anyway (i.e. Header RIGHT JOIN Results is the same as Results
            LEFT JOIN Header).  Configuring join logic in the RDMP database does not affect your data repository in any way (i.e. it doesn't mean we will suddenly start putting referential
            integrity constraints into your database!).</para>
             
            <para>You might wonder why you have to configure JoinInfo information into RDMP when it is possibly already implemented in your data model (e.g. with foreign key constraints).  The
            explicit record in the RDMP database allows you to hold corrupt/unlinkable data (which would violate a foreign key constraint) and still know that the tables must be joined. 
            Additionally it lets you configure joins between tables in different databases and to specify an explicit direction (LEFT / RIGHT / INNER) which is always the same when it comes
            time to extract your data for researchers.</para>
            
            <para>If you need to join on more than 1 column then just create a JoinInfo for each pair of columns (making sure the direction - LEFT/RIGHT/INNER matches).  For example if the join is
            Header.LabNumber = Results.LabNumber AND Header.Hospital = Results.Hospital (because of crossover in LabNumber between hospitals) then you would configure a JoinInfo for 
            Header.LabNumber = Results.LabNumber and another for Header.Hospital = Results.Hospital.</para>

             <summary>
             A Lookup in RDMP is a relationship between three columns.  The 'Foreign Key' column must come from a normal dataset table e.g. 'Prescribing.DrugCode', the 'Primary Key' must come
             from a different table (usually prefixed z_ to indicate it is a lookup table) e.g. 'z_DrugsLookup.DrugCode' and then a 'Description' column from the same table e.g. 
             'z_DrugsLookup.DrugName'.  This is maintained in the RDMP Catalogue database and does not result in any changes / constraints on your actual data repository.  
             
             <para>While it might seem redundant to have to configure this logic in the RDMP as well as (if you choose to) constraints in your data repository, this approach allows for 
             flexibility when it comes to incomplete/corrupt lookup tables (common in the research data management domain) as well as letting us bundle lookups with data extracts etc.</para>
             
             <para>This window is a low level alternative to LookupConfiguration (the recommended way of creating these Lookup relationships), this form lets you explicitly create a Lookup
             relationship using the supplied columns.  First of all you should make sure that the column you right clicked to activate the Form is the Description column.  Then select the
             'Primary Key' and 'Foreign Key' as described above.  </para>
             
             <para>If you have a particularly insane database design you can configure composite joins (where there are multiple columns that make up a composite 'Foreign Key' / 'Primary Key'.  For 
             example if there was crossover in 'DrugCode' between two countries then the Lookup relationship would need 'Primary Key' Prescribing.DrugCode + Prescribing.Country and the 
             'Foreign Key' would need to be z_DrugsLookup.DrugCode + z_DrugsLookup.Country.</para>
            
             <para>Allows you to rapidly import and configure lookup table relationships into the RDMP.  This has two benefits, firstly lookup tables will be automatically included in project extracts
             of the dataset you are editing.  Secondly lookup columns will be available for inclusion directly into the extraction on a per row basis (for researchers who can't deal with having
             to lookup the meaning of codes in separate files).</para>
             
             <para>Start by identifying a lookup table and click Import Lookup.  Then drag the primary key of the lookup into the PrimaryKey box.  Then drag the description column of the lookup onto the
             Foreign key field in the dataset you are modifying.  If you have multiple foreign keys (e.g. two columns SendingLocation and DischargeLocation both of which are location codes) then 
             join them both up (this will give you two lookup description fields SendingLocation_Desc and DischargeLocation_Desc).  </para>
             
             <para>All Lookups and Lookup column description configurations are artifacts in the RDMP database and no actual changes will take place on your data repository (i.e. no constraints will be added
             to the underlying data database). </para>

            All metadata in RDMP is stored in one of two main databases.  The Catalogue database records all the technical, descriptive, governance, data load, filtering logic etc about 
            your datasets (including where they are stored etc).  The Data Export Manager database stores all the extraction configurations you have created for releasing to researchers.
            
            <para>This window lets you tell the software where your Catalogue / Data Export Manager databases are or create new ones.  These connection strings are recorded in each users settings file.
            It is strongly advised that you use Integrated Security (Windows Security) for connecting rather than a username/password as this is the only case where Passwords are not encrypted
            (Since the encryption certificate location is stored in the Catalogue! - see PasswordEncryptionKeyLocationUI).</para>

            RDMP supports both Integrated Security (Windows User Account Security) and SQL Authentication.  The later requires the storing of usernames and passwords for sending at query time
            to the destination server.  In order to do this in a secure way RDMP encrypts them using 4096-bit RSA public/private key encryption.  By default this will use a PrivateKey that is
            part of the RDMP codebase but it is recommended that you create your own Private Key.  Without your own private key someone could decompile this software and decrypt the passwords
            stored in your RDMP database if it ever became compromised.
            
            <para>This control lets you create a custom 4096 bit RSA Private Key file.  The location of this file is stored in the RDMP database but the file itself should be held under access 
            control (see UserManual.docx).  This ensures that passwords are only compromised if both the RDMP database and the Windows user account file system (where the private key is held)
            are both compromised.</para>
            
            <para>It is only possible to have one key at any one time and once you generate a new one all your previously created passwords will be irretrievable so it is advisable to set this up

            an extraction transform/rule set (See ExtractionInformationUI) and a descriptive entity which describes what the researcher will receive if they are given the column in an extract.

            RDMP supports extracting all your metadata into DITA format (http://dita.xml.org/ - DITA OASIS Standard).  This is an XML standard with good tool support.  This form lets you

            the recommended route is to use the built in metadata reports (e.g. ConfigureMetadataReport).  Alternatively you can run queries directly on the RDMP Data Catalogue database
            which is a super relational database with many tables (Catalogue, CatalogueItem, SupportingDocument etc etc).

            Allows you to specify values for any IArgumentHost class.  This control is used by the user at 'design time' (e.g. when they are building a data load configuration) and the values
            are then populated into instantiated runtime instances (not that this control cares about how that happens).  You will see a list of all properties marked with [DemandsInitialization]
            on the argument host class.  Selecting the Argument will display the help text associated with the argument (user friendly message telling them what they are supposed to put in for that
            property) and an appropriate user control for providing a value (for example an enum will show a dropdown while a string property will show a text box - See ArgumentUI).

            be AnySeparatorFileAttacher or MDFAttacher).  Note that while T is IArgumentHost, it also should be tied to one or more interfaces (e.g. IAttacher) and able to host
            any child of that interface of which argumentsAreForUnderlyingType is the currently configured concrete class (e.g. AnySeparatorFileAttacher).

            Allows you to change high level attributes of an ExtractionConfiguration in a data extraction Project.  Executing an ExtractionConfiguration involves joining the 
            selected datasets against the selected cohort (and substituting the private identifiers for project specific anonymous release identifiers) as well as applying any
            configured filters (See ConfigureDatasetUI).  You can have multiple active configurations in a project, for example you might extract 'Prescribing', 'Biochemistry' and 'Demography' for the cohort 'CasesForProject123' and
            only datasets 'Biochemistry' and 'Demography' for the cohort 'ControlsForProject123'.
            
            <para>The attributes you can change include the name, description, ticketting system tickets etc.</para>
            
            <para>You can also define global SQL parameters which will be available to all Filters in all datasets extracted as part of the configuration.</para>
            
            <para>You can associate a specific CohortIdentificationConfiguration with the ExtractionConfiguration.  This will allow you to do a 'cohort refresh' (replace the current saved cohort 
            identifier list with a new version built by executing the query - helpful if you have new data being loaded regularly and this results in the study cohort changing).</para>

            As part of the ongoing effort to ensure extracted project data is correct (releasing incorrect data to a researcher is about the worst mistake you can make as a data analyst) a 
            feature was added which allows execution of aggregate graphs (See AggregateGraph) on the project extraction SQL.
            
            <para>This control lets you execute a dataset aggregate graph but restricted to the dataset extraction configuration you are working on (only including the records which will be extracted
            when you execute the project extraction).  This is achieved by adjusting the WHERE statement in the Aggregate SQL built by the AggregateBuilder to include the Cohort joins and any 
            data extraction filters.  Because of this transformation, depending on your indexes the graphs may take a long time to run (especially if the basic dataset aggregate graph takes a 
            long time to execute).</para>

            Part of DatasetRaceway, this control shows a miniature bar chart with 1 bar per month of data held within the dataset.  Bar colour indicates the proportion of records in that month
            which are passing/failing validation (green = passing, red = failing).  The month axis is shared across all datasets in the DatasetRaceway meaning that you see a continuous axis
            that spans the whole length of time you have been holding data for in any of your datasets.  The data for this graph comes from the Data Quality Engine evaluations database so if

            <para>Once you have set the logging server you should create or select an existing task (e.g. 'Loading Biochemistry' might be a good logging task for Biochemistry dataset).  All datasets
            in a given load (see LoadMetadataUI) must share the same logging task so it is worth considering the naming for example you might call the task 'Loading Hospital Data' and another
            'Loading Primary Care Data'.</para>
            
            <para>Data Extraction always gets logged under a task called 'Data Extraction' but the server you select here will be the one that it is logged against when the dataset is extracted.</para>
            
            <para>You can configure defaults for the logging servers of new datasets through ManageExternalServers dialog (See ManageExternalServers)</para>

            One big potential sources of data error in clinical datasets is duplication.  In the worst examples this is exact 100% duplication! for example a data provider loads the same data
            twice, a data entry clerk hits the submit button twice in a poorly written piece of clinical software etc.  The RDMP attempts to eliminate/reduce the potential for duplication by
            requiring that data loaded through the Data Load Engine (DLE) require that all tables being loaded have a Primary Key which comes from the source data (no autonums!).
            
            <para>Because primary keys cannot contain NULL values you are forced to create sensible primary keys (for example a Hospital Admissions dataset might have a primary key 
            'PatientIdentifier' and 'AdmissionDateTime').  By putting a primary key on the dataset we ensure that there cannot be duplicate data load replication (loading same record twice)
              and also ensure that there cannot be unlinkable records in the database (records where no 'Patient Identifier' exists or when we don't know what date the admission was on).</para>
            
            <para>When primary key collisions occur in a data load it becomes necessary to evaluate the cause (Done by evaluating RAW - see UserManual.docx Load Bubbles).  For example we might 
            determine that the data provider is sending us 2 records for the same patient on the same day, the records are identical except for a field 'DataAge'.  Rather than adding this 
            to the primary key it would make sense instead to discard the older record on load.</para>
            
            <para>This dialog (in combination with PrimaryKeyCollisionResolverMutilation - See UserManual.docx) lets you delete records out of RAW such that the remaining data matches the datasets
             primary key (obviously this is incredibly dangerous!).  This is done by applying a column order (with a direction for each column).  The dataset is subsetted by primary key with 
            each set ordered by the resolution order of the columns and the top record taken.</para>
            
            <para>In the above example we would put 'DataAge' as the first column in the resolution order and set it to descending (prefer records with a larger date i.e. newer records).  Direction
            is obvious in the case of dates/numbers (ascending = prefer the lowest, descending = prefer the highest) but in the case of strings the length of the string is used with (DBNull 
            being 0 length).</para>
            
            <para>Only use PrimaryKeyCollisionResolverMutilation (and this dialog) if you are CERTAIN you have the right primary key for the data/your researchers.</para>

            This dialog is shown when the RDMP learns about a new data table in your data repository that you want it to curate.  This can be either following a the successful flat file import
            or after selecting an existing table for importing metadata from (See ImportSQLTable).

             complex relationships are not modelled (e.g. there's no concept of someone being diabetic so just because someone is on INSULIN doesn't mean they will have diabetic blood tests

            The RDMP is designed to store sensitive clinical datasets and make them available in research ready (anonymous) form.  In this context it is a good idea to know who has access to 
            the data.   This dialog assists you with that (if you need it) by helping you set up an SQL Agent Job which enumerates all the database tables and database users and audits the 
            access levels over time (giving a longitudinal history of user access).
            
            <para>To use this functionality click 'Display Prerequisite SQL...' and run the script on the server you want to audit user permissions on.  This will create a database called Audit
            with several tables and stored procedures for auditing user access.  Test that it works by running 'exec Audit.dbo.UpdatePrivilegesAudit' and look at the contents of the table.</para>
            
            <para>Next you should set up an SQL Agent job to run nightly/weekly that executes that stores procedure (Audit.dbo.UpdatePrivilegesAudit).</para>
            
            <para>Once it has run once or twice you can use this dialog to Generate a word document report of user access either:

            Per Database - What databases / explicit permissions are set on each database</para>
            
            <para>TECHNICAL: All the information generated from the stored procedure comes from Sql Servers inbuilt user/database/permissions tables but these tables are not longitudinal which 
            is why we create the Audit database at all and need the periodic update.  If you don't want the database to be called Audit (e.g. because you already have a database called that)
            then you can do a find/replace on the Prerequisite SQL and set the Database correctly in this dialog when generating reports.</para>

            Allows you to take data in a single data table and bulk insert it into a database (which you pick at the top of the screen).  You must select or create an appropriate pipeline.
            This will consist of a source that is capable of reading your file (e.g. if the file is CSV use DelimitedFlatFileDataFlowSource) and zero or more middle components e.g. CleanStrings. 
            For destination your pipeline can have any destination that inherits from DataTableUploadDestination (this allows you to have custom plugin behaviour if you have some kind of
             weird database repository).  After the pipeline has executed and your database has been populated with the data table then the ForwardEngineerCatalogue dialog will appear which 
            will let you create a Catalogue reference in the DataCatalogue database for the new table.  Note that this dialog should only be used for 'one off' or 'getting started' style 
            loads, if you plan to routinely load this data table then give it a LoadMetadata (See LoadMetadataUI).

            Cohort identification in the RDMP is done by assembling patient sets and applying set operations on these sets (See 'Cohort Generation' in UserManual.docx).  For a use case of
            cohort identification see CohortIdentificationConfigurationUI.
            
            <para>The cohort identification requirements of researchers can sometimes be very complicated and so the RDMP is designed to help you split down the requirements into manageable bite
            sized pieces (Sets).</para>
            
            <para>Start by identifying the first dataset you will need to interrogate (e.g. if they want to know about diabetic medications drag in 'Prescribing').  Next double click the set
            and configure appropriate filters (See AggregateEditorUI) do not change the Dimension (this should already be the patient identifier).  Finally once you have configured
            the correct filters you should rename your set (AggregateConfiguration) to have a name that reflects the filters (e.g. 'People who have been prescribed a diabetic medication).</para>
            
            <para>Next identify the next dataset you need to interrogate (e.g. if they want to exclude patients who have a 'Biochemistry' test result of 'CREATANINE' > 100)  create this set as 
            you did above.  </para>
            
            <para>Then set the root container to EXCEPT such that your configuration is the first set of patients excluding the second set of patients.</para>
            
            <para>There are 3 set operations:</para>
             
            <para>UNION - All patients in any of the sets (e.g. patients prescribed opiates UNION patients who have attended a drug rehabilitation clinic outpatient appointment)
            INTERSECT - Only patients who are in all the sets (e.g. patients prescribed opiates WHO HAVE ALSO attended a drug rehabilitation clinic)
            EXCEPT - All patients in the first set throwing out any that are in subsequent sets (e.g. patients prescribed opiates EXCEPT those who have attended a drug rehabilitation clinic)</para>
            
            <para>Once you have configured your sets / set operations click 'Start All Tasks' to launch the SQL queries in parallel to the server.  If a set or container fails you can right click
            it to view the SQL error message or just look at the SQL the system has generated and run that manually (e.g. in Sql Management Studio). </para>
            
            <para>Once some of your sets are executing correctly you can improve performance by caching the identifier lists 'Cache Selected' (See Menu for how to do this).</para>
            
            <para>You will see an Identifier Count for each set, this is the number of unique patient identifiers amongst all records returned by the query.</para>
            
            <para>Ticking 'Include Cumulative Totals' will give you a second total for each set that is in a container with at least 1 other set, this is the number of unique identifiers after
            performing the set operation e.g.</para>

            to compare live vs cohort and easily visualise cohorts you are building in a CohortIdentificationConfiguration.  For example if you have an 'Aggregate Chart' which shows demography
            records for 5 healthboards over time then you combine it with a 'cohort set' "People who have lived in Tayside or Fife for at least 5 years" you should expect to see the graph only

            validation constraint which means rows with a null value in this field will fail validation.  Why would you do this you ask? when you can have a database constraint in your data
            repository that prevents null values? well sometimes research data is quite dirty and if a problematic field(especially if it is a non-essential column) is sometimes worth allowing
            it through even though it's null and highlighting problem records with the validation rule NotNull.

            Regular expressions are a great way of validating the content of your datasets.  For example you could have a regex pattern ^[MFU]$ which would force a cells contents to be either
            M, F or U with nothing else allowed.  Rather than having each data analyst type the same regular expression into the validation rules of each column you can create a StandardRegex.
            This StandardRegex will then be available as a validation rule for any column (See ValidationSetupForm).
            
            <para>Because regular expressions can get pretty complicated both a concept name and a verbose description that explains what the pattern matches and what it won't match.  You can also 
            test your implementation by typing values into the 'Testing Box' and clicking Test.  For example if you typed in 'Male' with the above pattern it would fail validation because it
            is not either an M or a F or a U.  If your pattern was [MFU] then it would pass because it contains an M! </para>

            Validation is an essential part of hosting research data.  If one month all the new records come in with values in gender of 'Male' and 'Female'  when previously they were 'M' or 
            'F' then you want to know about it (because it will affect filters and end users of the data who now have to include 2 different values in their WHERE statements).  In such a 
            trivial situation the first step would be to confirm if it is a mistake with the data provider, if not then a decision should be made whether to standardise on the old/new 
            categories and adjust the data load accordingly.
            
            <para>But for this to happen at all you need to be able to recognise when such problems occur.  The RDMP handles this by allowing you to specify validation rules on each of the 
            extractable columns / transforms you make available to researchers.  On the left of this form you can see all the columns/transforms.  By selecting one you can view/edit its'
            collection of Secondary Constraints (see SecondaryConstraintUI) and choose a Primary Constraint (Validates the datatype, only use a primary constraint if you have an insane
            schema such as using varchar(max) to store 'dates' and have dirty data that includes values like 'last friday' mixed in with legit values).</para>

            <summary>
            Part of CreateNewCohortIdentificationConfigurationUI.  Allows you to determine how the datasets in the CohortIdentificationConfiguration are combined to identify patients.  The options
            are 'Match All patients regardless of which dataset they appear in' and 'Match only patients who are in both datasets'.  If it is an Exclusion criteria then the result is what is subtracted
            from the matching cohorts (Inclusion criteria).  For example you could have Inclusion Criteria 'Anyone currently Resident in Tayside' and exclude 'Anyone who is dead' and 'Anyone who has
            ever been prescribed Aspirin', in this case the exclusion criteria would be 'Match All patients regardless of which dataset they appear in' since you want to throw out patients in either
            dataset.
